# Hello VSCode
### This project is a tutorial that covers the ins and outs of web development using a guide from Oliver James and the *InternetingisHard* team.
## HTML & CSS - 14 Chapter Guide
    - For this project I was instructed to complete each chapter of the tutorial in its own respective branch, however the main branch contains the first two chapters because I did them together.
    - This tutorial originally mentions installing the Atom text editor, but I used Visual Studio Code instead and completed the guide that way.
    - 'HTML & CSS is Hard' proclaimed that this guide was designed to be the only into to HTML & CSS that one would ever need. It walked me through the importance of text editors and everything inbetween to building web pages from scratch.

### Chapters & Their Respective Branches
1. Introduction (main) - purpose of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. Basic Web Pages (main) - "the skeleton for every web page", fundamental HTML
3. Links and Images (links-and-imgs) - linking to other pages, embedding images, etc.
4. Hello, CSS (hello-css) - connecting a stylesheet, styling HTML elements
5. The Box Model (css-box-model) - block/inline boxes, padding, borders, **ALL** boxes
6. CSS Selectors (css-selectors) - class selectors, $ div, pseudo-classes
7. Floats (floats) - Intro to CSS float layout
8. Flexbox (flexbox) - All things Flex, crafting modern CSS layouts
9. Advanced Positioning (advanced-positioning) - static, relative, absolute etc., fancy CSS
10. Responsive Design (responsive-design) - using media queries

#### I highly recommend stumbling through this guide and keeping it as a referance forever as it served its intended purpose, a great foundation.
## I wouldn't suggest forking this repo - *instead* , head over to <div align="center">[this link](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/)</div> and they'll walk you through this project as they did with me.
