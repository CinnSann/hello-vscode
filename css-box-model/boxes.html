    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
       elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

       

    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
       do not.</p>
    <p>Borders are common design elements, but they’re also invaluable for debugging. When you’re not sure how a box is being rendered, add a border: 1px solid red; declaration to it. This will clearly show the box’s padding, margin, and overall dimensions with just a single line of CSS. After you figured out why your stuff is broken, simply delete the rule.</p>
